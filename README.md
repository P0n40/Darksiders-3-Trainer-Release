## 🚀 How to Install and Use

Follow these steps carefully for the trainer to work properly:

1. **Extract the files**  
   Copy all files from the downloaded archive to your Desktop (or any convenient folder).

2. **Launch the game first**  
   Start **Darksiders III** and wait until it is **fully loaded into gameplay** (not just the main menu — you need to be in control of Fury in the world).

3. **Run the trainer**  
   Only **after** the game has fully loaded, run the **Darksiders 3 (+19) {mul0} [v215.465].exe** (as administrator recommended).

4. **Connect to the game**  
   If the game process is detected successfully, the **Connect** button (broken chain icon 🔗) in the upper-left panel of the trainer will become available.  
   Click it to connect/activate the trainer.

5. **Activate features**  
   After successful connection, you can use the hotkeys listed in the **Key Features** section (or shown directly in the trainer interface) to enable/disable cheats during gameplay.

## ⚠️ Warnings

- For **entertainment / single-player use only**.  
- May not work on other game versions.  
- Possible **false positive** from your antivirus — the trainer is clean, but add an exception or temporarily disable antivirus if it blocks the file.
- Always make a backup of your save files before using any cheats.
- Trainer works only with game version **215.465** (Steam license, process: Darksiders3-Win64-Shipping.exe [x64]).
- **Single-player only** — do not use in any online/multiplayer context.
